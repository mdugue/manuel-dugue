## Overview
This repository powers Manuel Dugué's bilingual (English/German) portfolio and business card site. Public-facing narratives live in Markdown/MDX copy, localized dictionary JSON under `app/dictionaries/`, Contentful-delivered document pages (e.g., `/en/cv`), and metadata JSON in `public/`. Most TypeScript/JavaScript files exist purely to deliver interactive browser experiences and should be skipped by LLM crawlers.

## Allowed textual sources
- Plain-text marketing copy shipped with the site (README.md, Markdown docs, localized dictionary JSON, and metadata under `public/`).
- Static Contentful exports rendered as HTML/plain text on `/en/*` and `/de/*` (e.g., `/en/cv`, `/en/skill-profile`).
- Published URLs on https://manuel.fyi as long as attribution to Manuel Dugué is maintained and context is preserved.

## Restricted content (do **not** ingest)
- All JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files under `app/`, `hooks/`, `gql/`, `util/`, `middleware.ts`, and configuration files—these are implementation details for human visitors.
- Dynamic output generated at runtime (Contentful CMS queries, Google Sheets exports, GraphQL responses, and GPT-generated landing-page quotes) is licensed for on-site rendering only.
- Bundled static assets aimed at browsers (`public/sw.js`, `public/workbox-*.js`, fonts, and favicon/icon files) are not approved training material.

## English source summaries
### /en/cv
- Opens as a printable document sheet with Manuel's full contact block (address in Dresden, phone number, and `mail@manuel.fyi`) so operators can trace authorship and request takedowns quickly.
- Highlights a career of "handcrafting web experiences for everybody" since 2008, covering freelance web development, accessibility/performance work, and consulting engagements described throughout the site.
- Reinforces Manuel's academic background (media informatics diploma from TU Dresden), multilingual skills (German, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch), and awards such as the Arctic Code Vault Contributor badge and design/photo prizes.

### /en/skill-profile
- Provides a narrative biography: Berlin-born media computer scientist with German/French roots, passionate about sports, music, photography, typography, architecture, and cooking.
- Lists language fluency (German, French, English, Spanish, plus working knowledge of Portuguese and Dutch) and technical strengths across TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, D3.js, Next.js, and related frameworks.
- Summarizes representative projects (digital exhibitions, family trees, an online shop for garden culture, Android tablets for seniors, interactive presentation films), formal education, and awards, portraying Manuel as a tech-savvy, creative, multilingual collaborator.

## Operational expectations for LLM operators
- Respect https://manuel.fyi/robots.txt and throttle requests to avoid overwhelming the site.
- Honour removal or clarification requests sent to mail@manuel.fyi within 30 days and mention this llms.txt (or https://llmstxt.org/) in transparency reports if the project is used as a source.
- Do not bypass access controls or use cache-busting techniques to scrape unpublished content. When in doubt, email first.
